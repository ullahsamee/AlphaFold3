# Kuhlman Lab Installation of AlphaFold3

This is an unofficial repo that wraps around [Google Deepmind's AlphaFold3](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3). It extends some of the official repo's functionality and utilizes [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) and its MMseqs2 server for protein MSA and template generation.

This repository will be updated frequently so be sure to pull the newest version from GitHub often. **If files in `src/alphafold3` change, you MUST re-run Step 7 from Installation below to reinstall AF3.**

## Getting started

### Installation
1. Make a new conda/mamba environment:
`mamba create -p .conda/envs/af3 python=3.11`

2. Activate the new environment:
`mamba activate af3`

3. Clone this GitHub repository:
`https://github.com/Kuhlman-Lab/alphafold3.git`

4. Install extra dependencies:
`mamba install zlib gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 requests hmmer -c bioconda`

5. Install CUDA Toolkit 12.6:
`mamba install -c nvidia cuda-toolkit=12.6`

6. Install AF3 Python dependencies:
`pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt`

7. Install the AF3 source code:
`pip3 install --no-deps .`

8. Run `build_data` (this was created in step 7):
`build_data`

### AF3 weights
AF3 weights **must be acquired and used** as outlined by the [official AF3 repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3).

Once acquired, make a new directory called `models` in the base `alphafold3` folder and place the weights file (e.g. `af3.bin.zst`) inside.

### First prediction

After installation and getting access to the AF3 weights, you're ready for your first prediction! 

For this, we'll create a JSON file specifying our input. Create a new file called `alphafold_input.json` with the contents:
```
{
    "name": "Top7",
    "sequences": [
      {
        "protein": {
          "id": ["A"],
          "sequence": "MGDIQVQVNIDDNGKNFDYTYTVTTESELQKVLNELMDYIKKQGAKRVRISITARTKKEAEKFAAILIKVFAELGYNDINVTFDGDTVTVEGQLEGGSLE"
        }
      }
    ],
    "modelSeeds": [1]
}
```
This file specifies that we want to make an AF3 prediction with 1 seed for Top7, which consists of a single protein chain. 

Now, we'll simply call the `run_af3.py` script, point to this file, use `--output_dir af3_preds` to contain our predictions, and include `--run_mmseqs` to indicate we want to use MMseqs to generate MSAs and templates for our query:
`python run/run_af3.py --json_path alphafold_input.json --output_dir af3_preds --run_mmseqs`

Once you see 
```
Done processing fold input 2PV7.
Done processing 1 fold inputs.
```
your prediction has completed! You'll find the predicted structures (`*.cif`) and some confidence predictions in your new `af3_preds` folder.

For more complicated inputs and examples, please refer to the [input format documentation](docs/input.md) and the `examples` folder.
